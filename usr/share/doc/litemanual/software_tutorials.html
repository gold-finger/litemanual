				<p><strong><font size="4">General Information</font></strong></p><br />
				<p>This page is a work in progress.  Over time more tutorials will be added
				to it.  Some of them may deal with software that is already included in the
				standard Linux Lite installation.  Many will be for software that needs to
				be installed first because it is not part of the standard installation. Two
				choices listed under <strong>Menu -> System</strong> will be used frequently
				for installing software.  Below are pictures of both for your reference in 
				the tutorials.  (If a tutorial requires something different from these, it
				will contain screenshots for that specific situation.)</p>
				<br />
				<p>What you will see when installing from <strong>Menu ->System ->
				Install Additional Software</strong>:</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/additional_software-01.png" 
				alt="additional_software-01.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/additional_software-02.png" 
				alt="additional_software-02.png" /></p>
				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  The menu you see for 'Install Additional Software'
				may be different than shown here because of new software additions over time.</p><br />
				<p>What you will see when installing from <strong>Menu -> System ->
				Install/Remove Software</strong> (Synaptic Package Manager).</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/synaptic-01.png" alt="synaptic-01.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/synaptic-02.png" alt="synaptic-02.png" /></p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="keepassx">KeePassX</a></font></strong></p><br />
				<p>KeePassX is a password manager program used for securely creating and storing
				passwords.  It includes a password generator that will create strong passwords
				for you.  When using KeePassX, you only need to remember one password -- the one
				you use for opening the program!  Once your KeePassX data file is opened,
				transferring a password from the program to its entry form is done quickly
				and easily with a few mouse clicks.</p>
				<p>To install, go to <strong>Menu -> System -> Install Additional Programs</strong>, 
				type the number corresponding to KeePassX from the list shown in the pop-up window 
				and enter your password when prompted for it.</p>
				<p>After it's installed you can start it from <strong>Menu -> Accessories ->
				KeePassX</strong>.  On your first startup you will need to create a new database
				for your passwords -- click the interface button for that in the upper-left corner.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-01.png" border="1" alt="keepassx-01.png" /></p><br />
				<p>You will then be prompted to make a master password for the database that will
				contain your passwords.  This is the only password you will need to remember.
				Do your best to make one that you not only can remember, but is strong also.  Make
				it reasonably long with a combination of letters, numbers and other characters
				if possible.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-02.png" alt="keepassx-02.png" /></p><br />
				<p>After entering your password you will see that the database is now populated
				with two <strong>groups</strong> shown on the left: <strong>Internet</strong> and
				<strong>eMail</strong>.  Groups are just ways to organize your passwords according
				to their use.  (You can edit, delete and create new groups by clicking <strong>'Groups'</strong>
				along the top of the window.)</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-03.png" alt="keepassx-03.png" /></p><br />
				<p>To create a password entry, click the 'Add New Entry' button along the top.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-04.png" border="1" alt="keepassx-04.png" /></p><br />
				<p>Select which group the password should fall under, fill-in your information, 
				then enter your password (if you already have one) or click on the <strong>'Gen'</strong>
				button to bring up the <strong>Password Generator</strong> to make one for you.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-05.png" alt="keepassx-05.png" /></p><br />
				<p>In the <strong>Password Generator</strong> you can specify the types of characters
				to include, the password length, etc., along with the option to enable entropy
				collection to further strengthen the password.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-06.png" alt="keepassx-06.png" /></p><br />
				<p>If you enable <strong>entropy collection</strong> move your mouse around randomly
				when the collection window pops up.  The mouse data will be incorporated by the 
				algorithm to produce the random password.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-07.png" alt="keepassx-07.png" /></p><br />
				<p>When it's done, hit 'OK' and it will fill-in the password it produced for you. 
				If you would like to see it, click the eye symbol next to the password box.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-08.png" alt="keepassx-08.png" /></p><br />
				<p>Click 'OK' when you are satisfied with everything and your new password entry
				will now appear in the list for the group you put it under.  When you are done
				making your entries (or changes to existing ones), make sure save everything by
				clicking to click the <strong>Save Database</strong> button along the top of the
				window.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-09.png" alt="keepassx-09.png" /></p><br />
				<p>A dialog box will pop-up for you to specify a name for the file and where to
				save it.  It will automatically put the '.kdb' (keepassx data base) extension on
				the file name and it will default to saving it in your home folder.  (You can
				designate a different location to save to if you'd like.)  So the example
				below will save a file called 'my-keepassx-data.kdb' under /home/bill.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-10.png" alt="keepassx-10.png" /></p><br />
				<p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT!</strong><br />
				<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be sure to make at least one extra copy
				of your '.kdb' file to an external source, like a USB backup stick.</span>  If 
				your hard drive fails, or something else goes wrong that prevents you from 
				retrieving your files you will lose all of your passwords and access to the 
				accounts you set them for.  That will not be a pleasant experience if you don't
				have a backup copy made -- so do that immediately and update it every time you make
				changes to the database.</p><br />
				<p><strong>Using KeePassX is simple!</strong></p>  
				<p>Start KeePassX and highlight the site you want to log into.  Navigate to the website,
				then click the <strong>person icon</strong> along the top of the KeePassX window to
				copy your username to the clipboard temporarily.  Right-click in the website entry field
				for it and paste.  Click the <strong>key icon</strong> (next to the person icon) to 
				copy the password to the clipboard and paste it into the website password field.  That's
				all there is to it!  (Note:  the information is automatically deleted from the clipboard
				after 20 seconds.  You can change that and other settings by going to 
				<strong>Extras -> Settings -> Security</strong>.)</p>

				<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="plank">Plank Dock</a></font></strong></p><br />
				<p>Plank is a lightweight docking application for program launchers and works
				well with the Xfce desktop used in Linux Lite.  Conveniently add launchers for
				all of your favorite programs on the launcher for quick, easy access.  The Plank
				dock can be positioned along any edge of the screen.  You can start the dock
				from the main menu or have it start automatically upon boot-up of the computer.</p>
				<p>Plank is one of the applications you can add easily from the <strong>Install
				Additional Software</strong> section in the <strong>Menu</strong>.  The Plank
				installer in Linux Lite will also download and install many different themes
				for the dock and put a dark <strong>plank-themer-ondock</strong> icon on the
				dock, which you can click to list and choose from the different themes.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/themer_icon.png" alt="themer_icon.png" /></p><br />
				<p>The dock themes will not display properly unless <i>compositing</i> is enabled;
				so do the following to make sure you have it enabled.</p>
				<p>Go to <strong>Menu -> Settings -> Settings Manager</strong>, then choose
				<strong>Window Manager Tweaks</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/win_mgr_tweaks.png" alt="win_mgr_tweaks.png" /></p><br />
				<p>Click the <strong>Compositor</strong> tab and click "Enable display compositing".</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/compositor.png" alt="compositor.png" /></p><br />
				<p>Now you're ready to install Plank.  Go to <strong>Menu -> System -> 
				Install Additional Software</strong> and choose <strong>Plank Dock</strong> from
				the applications listed in the pop-up.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/install_plank.png" alt="install_plank.png" /></p><br />
				<p>When installation is complete you will find <strong>Plank</strong> listed under
				<strong>Menu -> Accessories</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/menu_plank.png" alt="menu_plank.png" /></p><br />
				<p><strong>POSITIONING THE DOCK</strong></p>
				<p>Plank's default position is centered along the bottom of your screen display.
				If your panel is also along the bottom it will block part of the dock.  You will
				need to move either the dock or the panel to a different position.  Either one
				of them can be moved to the top, bottom, or either side of the screen.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/plank-01.png" border="1" alt="plank-01.png" /></p><br />
				<ul>
					<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To Move the Panel:</span></strong><br />
					<br />
						<ul>
							<li>Right-click an empty area on the panel</li>
							<li>Choose: <strong>Panel -> Panel Preferences -> Display (tab)</strong></li>
							<li>Uncheck the "Lock Panel" box</li>
							<li>With mouse, grab either <u>end</u> of the panel to move it</li>
							<li>Lock the panel again after move to new position</li>
							<li>Note:  change <strong>'Mode'</strong> to 'Deskbar' or 'Vertical' if you want the
							panel on one of the sides of the display.</li>
						</ul>
					</li><br />
					<br />
					<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To Move the Plank Dock:</span></strong><br />
					<br />
						<ul>
							<li>Open your file manager, click <strong>View -> Show Hidden Files</strong></li>
							<li>Navigate to <strong>.config/plank/dock1</strong> and open the <strong>settings</strong>
							file (with <strong>leafpad</strong> text editor).</li>
							<li>Or, from <strong>Terminal</strong> enter this command:  <strong><code>leafpad 
							~/.config/plank/dock1/settings</code></strong></li>
							<li>In opened <strong>settings</strong> file (see pic below under 'All Other Plank
							Dock Settings' heading):
								<ul>
									<li>Change value in line #18 according to the description on previous line #17</li>
									<li>Save the file</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>If setting did not take immediate effect, right-click the <strong>Plank</strong>
							icon on the dock and select 'Quit' to close the dock.</li>
							<li>Re-start the dock from <strong>Menu -> Accessories -> Plank</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br /><br />
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/plank_settings-1.png" alt="plank_settings-1.png" /></p><br />
				<p>After the move operation you will be able to see the dock properly.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/plank-02.png" border="1" alt="plank-02.png" /></p><br />
				<p><strong>ADDING PROGRAM LAUNCHERS TO THE DOCK</strong></p>
				<p>When you open a program from the Menu it will then appear on the dock.  When you close
				the application its icon will then disappear from the dock.  For programs you use often,
				you'll want to keep them on the dock for easy access so you don't need to navigate the
				Menu.  There are two basic ways to accomplish that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open a program through the <strong>Menu</strong>, right-click the icon that appears
					on the dock and choose 'Keep in Dock'.</li>
					<li>Open the <strong>Menu</strong>, find program to add, then drag it and drop it
					on the dock.</li>
				</ol>
				<br /><br />
				<p><strong>REMOVING PROGRAM LAUNCHERS FROM THE DOCK</strong></p>
				<p>Two ways to remove items from the dock are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Right-click the launcher icon and un-select 'Keep on Dock'.</li>
					<li>Simply grab, drag and drop the icon somewhere off of the dock.</li>
				</ol>
				<br /><br />
				<p><strong>ARRANGING LAUNCHER POSITIONS ON THE DOCK</strong></p>
				<p>You can change the order of items on the dock by grabbing them with
				your mouse and moving them to the right or left and dropping them
				into place.  The dark <strong>plank-themer-ondock</strong> icon is
				the only one you can not grab.  To change its position on the dock,
				move the other icons to its left or right until it ends up where you'd
				like it to reside.</p><br />
				<p><strong>CHANGING THE DOCK'S THEME</strong></p>
				<p>Click on the dark <strong>themer</strong> icon to see a list of almost
				30 themes to choose from.  Click the one you want and the dock will 
				change to it without the need for a restart of Plank. Here are a few
				theme examples.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/theme-1.png" border="1" alt="theme-1.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/theme-2.png" border="1" alt="theme-2.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/theme-3.png" border="1" alt="theme-3.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/theme-4.png" border="1" alt="theme-4.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/theme-5.png" border="1" alt="theme-5.png" /></p>
				<br />
				<p><strong>LAUNCHING MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE OF A PROGRAM</strong></p>
				<p>When you click the launcher of a program that is already running, it
				will bring that running window into focus on the screen (bring it to
				the foreground).  If instead you would like to launch another instance of
				the program then:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Middle mouse click on the launcher icon, or</li>
					<li>Use 'Ctrl' key while left-clicking the icon with your mouse.</li>
				</ul>
				<br /><br />
				<p><strong>SETUP PLANK TO START AUTOMATICALLY ON BOOT</strong></p>
				<p>Go to <strong>Menu -> Settings -> Session and Startup -> Application
				Autostart (tab)</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hit '+' button to add new startup entry</li>
					<li><strong>Name</strong> = Plank Dock</li>
					<li><strong>Description</strong> = Start Plank dock on startup</li>
					<li><strong>Command</strong> = plank</li>
					<li>Click 'OK' when done</li>
				</ul><br />
				<p>Close the <strong>Session and Startup</strong> window when done.  Your next
				reboot will start Plank automatically.</p><br />
				<p><strong>ALL OTHER PLANK DOCK SETTINGS</strong></p>
				<p>All other settings can be adjusted through the dock's <strong><code>settings</code></strong>
				file.  Use your file manager or the terminal to open file located in the
				<strong><code>~/.config/plank/dock1</code></strong> directory.  (Remember to set file manager
				to 'View Hidden Files'.)  You can edit various lines in the file to make your changes.
				If changes do not take effect immediately after saving the changed file, quit and
				restart Plank.  Please refer to the following picture while reading about the various
				settings that can be changed.</p>
				<p>(Note: we hope to have a working GUI interface for these settings available
				within a couple of months, time permitting.)</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/plank_settings-2.png" alt="plank_settings-2.png" /></p><br />
				<p>Changes that you can make by editing the <strong><code>settings</code></strong>
				file are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>(Lines #5-6) Show only windows of the current workspace on the dock.
						<ul>
							<li>False = icons show on dock for programs opened on any workspace</li>
							<li>True = only icons for the current workspace show on the dock</li>
						</ul>
					</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #7-8) Change the size of the launcher icons on the dock</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #9-12) Control hiding behavior and time delay for hiding the dock</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #13-14) Set which monitor to show the dock on if you have more than one.</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #15-16) DO NOT MODIFY</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #17-18) Specify which edge of the screen to position dock on.</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #19-20) Offset the dock from center position
						<ul>
							<li>20 would offset the dock to the right of center by 20 percent</li>
							<li>-20 would offset the dock to the left of center by 20 percent</li>
						</ul>
					</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #21-22) Name of dock theme to use.  This is handled automatically
					by using the <strong>themer</strong> icon on the dock.  You can change themes
					manually here if you need to.</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #23-24) Change the dock alignment on the screen edge it is on.
					For example, if you have the dock along the bottom edge, you can center it,
					align left, or align it right.  You can also choose 'panel-mode' to make the
					dock appear like a panel instead of a dock.</li><br />
					<li>(Lines 25-26) If 'panel-mode' was chosen, you can align the launcher icons
					on the panel</li><br />
					<li>(Lines 27-28) Enable or disable the ability to drag and drop items from the
					panel for deletion.  If you find that you have problems accidentally dragging things
					off the dock and deleting them, change this setting.</li><br />
					<li>(Lines 29-30) Pressure-based revealing of the dock if that is supported.</li>
