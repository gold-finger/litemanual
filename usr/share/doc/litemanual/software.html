				<p><b><font size="4"><a name="software"></a>Installing &amp; 
				Removing Software</font></b></p>
				<p>Installing and removing software in Linux is much easier than in Windows.  The 
				vast majority of programs that you may want/need to install are all centrally
				located in what are called software repositories (repos).  Rather than searching the 
				web, downloading programs from various sites (some of which may not be reliable), 
				running the installer, rebooting, etc., available software is all centrally 
				located and available for installation in seconds.  The packages/(programs) in the 
				repositories are tested, approved for inclusion in the repos and securely signed
				to insure their validity.</p>
				<p>There are a few common methods for installing and removing software.  Linux 
				Lite comes with the Synaptic Package Manager.  When you already know the name of
				the program you want, Synaptic makes installing easy.</p>  
				
				<p><b>IMPORTANT: Before you run Install/Remove 
				Software for the first time, <a href="#sources">read this first</a>.<br>
				Then come back to here to learn how to install and remove software.</b></p>
				<p>To install software use the following steps:</p>
				<p>1. Click on <b>Menu</b>, <b>System</b>, <b>Install/Remove 
				Software</b></p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/software/menu_synaptic.jpg" class="auto-style1"></p>
				<p>2. Make sure <b>All</b> is selected in the left pane and in the <b>Quick Filter</b> 
				or spy glass
				<img border="0" src="img/software/spyglass.png"> type in your search query. In 
				this example we will search for the &#39;<b>audacious</b>&#39; music 
				player.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="1" src="img/software/synaptic_search.png"></p>
				<p>3. Double click on the package you want to install.</p>
				<p>4. Some software will ask you to <b>Mark additional required 
				changes?</b> These are also known as dependencies and are 
				required for the program to function properly.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/software/synaptic_deps.png"></p>
				<p>5. Click on <b>Mark</b>. Now hit the <b>Apply</b> button on 
				the Synaptic toolbar. The software will install and a <b>Menu</b> 
				entry will be created in the relevant <b>Menu</b> category. For 
				<b>audacious</b> 
				the <b>Menu</b> category would be <b>Multimedia</b>.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="1" src="img/software/synaptic_apply.png"></p>
				<p>6. Go to the <b>Menu</b> and your new software will be there. 
				An alternative way to find your new software is to click on <b>
				Menu</b>, <b>Accessories</b>, <b>Application Finder</b>. Type 
				your program name in the <b>Search</b> box and the result will 
				display on the right. Double click on the program name and it 
				will launch for you.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/software/app_finder.jpg"></p>
				<p><b>Uninstalling Software:</b></p>
				<p>7.<b> </b>Uninstalling software is the reverse process of 
				installing software in the <b>Synaptic Package Manager</b>. Type 
				the name of the software into the <b>Quick Filter</b> or spy 
				glass
				<img border="0" src="img/software/spyglass.png"> box.</p>
				<p>8. Right click on the software and select <b>Mark for Removal</b>. 
				Now hit the <b>Apply</b> button on the Synaptic toolbar and your 
				software will uninstall. Be very careful with this process as 
				you can inadvertently uninstall crucial system software. If you 
				have any doubts, please search the net first to see if it is 
				safe to uninstall the software. Synaptic is pretty good at 
				warning you should there be any potential problems.</p>

				<p><b><a name="updates"><font size="4">Updates</font></a></b></p>
				<p>Keeping Linux Lite up to date is a simple process.</p>
				<p>At the top of your <b>Menu</b>, you will see <b>Install 
				Updates</b>.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/software/menu_updates.jpg"></p>
				<p>We&#39;ve made the update process as simple as possible. Simply 
				click on <b>Install Updates</b> and you will be asked for your 
				password. The program will then search for updates and if it 
				finds any it will ask you if you want to continue. Type <b>Y</b> 
				and then hit enter if you do.</p>
				<p>(<b>Note:</b> The update process updates all software on the system that 
				came from the repos.  Unlike in Windows, there is no need to 
				update individual software programs manually.  When you run <b>Install Updates</b>, that will update
				all packages that have updates available for them.)</p>

				<a/>
				<p>To ensure that you get your updates and software downloaded 
				as fast as possible, try selecting a location close to you.<br>
				In the following tutorial we will show you how to do this.</p>
				<p>Click on <b>Menu, System, Install/Remove Software</b> and 
				enter your password.</p></a>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/sources-password.jpg"></p>
				<p><b>Synaptic Package Manager</b> will open up, click on <b>
				Settings, Repositories</b>.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/software/sources-repos.jpg" class="auto-style1"></p>
				<p>The <b>Software Sources</b> window will pop up. From the <b>
				Download from:</b> drop down box, select <b>Other...</b></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/sources-other.jpg"></p>
				<p>A <b>Choose a Download Server</b> box will pop up. From here 
				select your country, and then a server, preferably an Ubuntu 
				server if it is listed or another server if an Ubuntu server is 
				not in the list. Click on the <b>Choose Server</b> button once 
				you have made your selection. Now click on <b>Close</b> in the
				<b>Software Sources</b> window.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/sources-country.jpg"></p>
				<p>In the top left of the <b>Synaptic Package Manager</b> 
				window, click on the <b>Reload</b> button. This will change all 
				the software sources to your location for faster downloads.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/software/sources-reload.jpg" class="auto-style1"></p>
				<p>The following window will appear, then close when it has 
				finished.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/sources-reload2.jpg"></p>
				<p>You should now have faster downloads for updates and software 
				installs in <b>Synaptic Package Manager</b> from a location much 
				nearer you. Click <a href="#software">here</a> to learn how to

				<p><b><font size="4"><a name="additional"></a>Install 
				Additional Software</font></b></p>
				<p>Installing some of the more widely popular programs on Linux 
				Lite like Chrome, Dropbox and Skype is just a few simple steps 
				on Linux Lite. You can also choose to update your system at any 
				time by choosing option <strong>24</strong> (see below).</p>
				<p>Go to <strong>Menu, System, Install Additional Software</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/inadd/inadd1.jpg" /></p>
				<p>Next, you'll see the following window pop up. Select a piece 
				of software, in this example we'll choose to install the <strong>
				Chrome Web Browser</strong>, press the <strong>2</strong> key 
				and then enter.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/inadd/inadd2.png" /></p>
				<p>In the next dialog, we can see some information regarding the 
				software we have chosen to install. It pays to read this each 
				time as the information is a very important part of the install 
				process. Click <strong>Yes</strong> when ready.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/inadd/inadd3.jpg" /></p>
				<p>Enter your password and click <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/inadd/inadd4.jpg" /></p>
				<p>The program is now being downloaded and installed 
				automatically for you. This can take anywhere from a few seconds 
				to a few minutes depending on the size of the program and the 
				speed of your internet connection.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/inadd/inadd5.jpg" /></p>
				<p>When the install is complete, you'll be given the option of 
				using your software straight away. Click <strong>Yes</strong> if 
				you want to do this.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/inadd/inadd6.jpg" /></p>
				<p>If you select <strong>No</strong>, the dialog box will inform 
				you where to find your newly installed program.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/inadd/inadd7.jpg" /></p>
				<p>If at anytime you wish to exit the program, select option
				<strong>0</strong> and press enter.</p>

				<p>Removing Additional Software in Linux Lite is just a few 
				simple steps.</p>
				<p>Click on <strong>Menu, System, Remove Additional Software</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>You'll get a confirmation at this point asking if you want to 
				proceed, type <strong>y</strong> and press enter.&nbsp;If you chose 
				the wrong menu option in the beginning, type <strong>n</strong> 
				and press enter, this will take you back to the main Remove 
				Additional Software menu.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/remadd/remadd4.png" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The software is now being removed. Once this is completed,

				<p><a name="ppa"></a><b><font size="4">Adding a PPA</font></b></p>
				<p>A PPA is a repository containing one or more applications. 
				These are often set up for new software programs or updated 
				versions of some applications. To add a new PPA to your system, 
				follow the guide below.</p>
				<p>Go to <b>Menu, System, Install/Remove Programs</b>. Enter 
				your password when asked.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/ppa1.jpg"></p>
				<p>Go to <b>Settings, Repositories</b>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/ppa2.jpg" class="auto-style1"></p>
				<p>Click on the <b>Other Software</b> tab and click on the <b>Add
				</b>(bottom left) button and paste into the box the address of 
				the PPA.<br>
				In this example, we are going to add <b>Spotify</b> to our 
				system. Now click on <b>Add Source</b>. To finish, click on <b>
				Close</b>.<br>
				Close <b>Synaptic Package Manager</b>.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/ppa3.png"></p>
				<p>Each PPA comes with a signed key. This is a security measure 
				and ensures that the person who created the PPA has followed 
				strict standards. Open up a terminal and type in the key string:</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table1" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td><b>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 
						--recv-keys 94558F59</b></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/ppa4.png"></p>
				<p>Now in the same terminal type in:</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table2" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td><b>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; 
				sudo apt-get install spotify-client</b></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/ppa5.png"></p>
				<p>This will update your sources to include the new Spotify 
				repository. The second part of the command will install Spotify 
				for you. Your new program is now installed and ready to use.</p>

				<p><b><font size="4"><a name="encrypt"></a>File Encryption</font></b></p>
				<p>In todays world, security of your personal files is 
				important. Whether your transporting documents on a USB drive or 
				emailing sensitive information to a friend, colleague or company, 
				encryption is a necessary security measure.</p>

				<p>1. First we need to install the encryption software, in this 
				example we'll use
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mcrypt" target="_blank">
				mcrypt</a>. Encryption algorithms include DES, Blowfish, 
				ARCFOUR, Enigma, GOST, LOKI97, RC2, Serpent, Threeway, Twofish, 
				WAKE, and XTEA.</p>
				<p>Open a terminal and type:</p>
				<p><strong>sudo apt-get install mcrypt -y</strong></p>
				<p>2. Once mcrypt is installed, we'll set a custom right click 
				action in our file manager to make encryption of files super 
				easy. Open up your home folder, click on <strong>Edit, Configure 
				custom actions</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt1.jpg" /></p>
				<p>3. Click the plus + button on the right and enter in the 
				following information, in the <strong>Command</strong> box type 
				in:</p>
				<p><strong>x-terminal-emulator -t "Encrypt file..." -e "mcrypt 
				%f"</strong></p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt2.jpg" /></p>
				<p>Click on <strong>Appearance Conditions</strong> tab and tick 
				every box except <strong>Directories</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt2a.png" /></p>
				<p>4. Go back to the <strong>Basic</strong> tab and click on the
				<strong>No icon</strong> button and browse to <strong>Status 
				Icons</strong>, and select the <strong>changes-prevent</strong> 
				icon and click on <strong>Ok</strong>, then <strong>Ok</strong> 
				on the next box.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt3.jpg" /></p>
				<p>Your <strong>Custom Actions</strong> box should now look like 
				this:</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt4.jpg" /></p>
				<p>5. Now we need to set up the <strong>Decrypt</strong> option. 
				Repeat step 3 only this time enter in the following information, 
				in the <strong>Command</strong> box type in:</p>
				<p><strong>x-terminal-emulator -t "Decrypt file..." -e "mcrypt 
				-d %f"</strong></p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt5.jpg" /></p>
				<p>Click on <strong>Appearance Conditions</strong> tab and
				<strong>only</strong> tick the <strong>Other Files</strong> box, 
				leave the rest unticked.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt5a.png" /></p>
				<p>6. Repeat step 4 only this time select the <strong>
				changes-allow</strong> icon. The click on <strong>Ok</strong>, 
				then <strong>Ok</strong> on the next box.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt6.jpg" /></p>
				<p>7. Your <strong>Custom Actions</strong> box should now look 
				like this:</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt7.jpg" /></p>
				<p>8. Click on the <strong>Close</strong> button on the <strong>
				Custom Actions</strong> box.</p>
				<p>Now we're ready to encrypt a file (only files can be 
				encrypted with this method, not folders)</p>
				<p>9. Right click on a file and select <strong>Encrypt file</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt8.jpg" /></p>
				<p>10. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password, it 
				will then ask you to enter the same password again. Choose a 
				good strong password, a mixture of letters, numbers and 
				characters that you can easily remember.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt9.png" /></p>
				<p>You can now delete the unencrypted file permanently.<br />
				Here you will see we have a new file with the letters '<strong>.nc</strong>' 
				attached to the end of it signifying that the file is now 
				encrypted.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt10.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>11. To decrypt the file later, right click on the file and 
				select <strong>Decrypt file</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt11.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>12. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password. 
				Enter the password you created in step 10.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt12.png" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>As you can see our file is decrypted and ready to view.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt13.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>If you make any changes to the decrypted file, you need to 
				delete the existing encrypted file and re-encypt the changed 
				file.</p>

				<p><a name="archive"></a><b><font size="4"><a/>Creating and 
				Extracting Zip files</a></font></b></p>
				<p>Sometimes we may have a collection of pictures to send 
				someone over email. Good practice is to zip these files up so 
				that the overall size is much less. The following is an example 
				of how to zip files and folders.</p>
				<p>Linux Lite supports creation and extraction of these file 
				types: <b>.zip .rar .tar .tar.gz .tar.bz2 .7z</b></p>
				<p><b>Creating a zip file</b></p>
				<p>Right click on any file or folder and select <b>Create 
				Archive</b>.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-01.jpg"></p>
				<p>A new window will pop up. From here, type in the <b>Name:</b> 
				of the file eg. <b>file.zip<br>
				</b>For the <b>Archive type</b> select <b>zip</b> and when you 
				are ready, click on the <b>Create</b> button.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-02.jpg"></p>
				<p>We now have a file called <b>file.zip</b></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-03.jpg"></p>
				<p><b>Zipping up multiple files</b></p>
				<p>Best practice here is to place all the files you want to zip 
				up into a folder. In this example we have a folder called <b>
				holiday</b> and inside 4 files.</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/software/archive/archive-04.jpg"></p>
				<p>Go back to your home folder and right click on the folder 
				containing the files you wish to zip up.<br>
				Right click the folder and select <b>Create Archive</b></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-05.jpg"></p>
				<p>A new window will pop up. From here, type in the <b>Name:</b> 
				of the file eg. <b>holiday.zip<br>
				</b>For the <b>Archive type</b> select <b>zip</b> and when you 
				are ready, click on the <b>Create</b> button.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-06.jpg"></p>
				<p>We now have a zip file called <b>holiday.zip</b></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-07.jpg"></p>
				<p><b>Extracting Zip files</b></p>
				<p>Right click on the zip file and select <b>Extract Here</b></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-08.jpg"></p>
				<p>We how have a folder called holiday, with our 4 files inside 
				of it.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-09.jpg"></p>
